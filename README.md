## Compatible Version
- Ubuntu 22.04
- ROS2 Humble

## Basic Setup
- Setup for workspace and install dependency package.

```
$ cd ~/
$ mkdir -p wego_ws/src
$ cd ~/wego_ws/src
$ git clone -b ros2 https://github.com/WeGo-Robotics/LimoIsaacSIM.git
$ cd ..
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
$ colcon build
```
## View Sensor data 
You can see the sensor data with RViz
```

# With Limo Isaac sim played
$ cd ~/wego_ws
$ source install/setup.bash

# For the first terminal(laser filter, joystick bridge)
$ ros2 launch wego preset_launch.py

# Second terminal launch navigation
